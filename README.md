# Baby-Boomers

A site dedicated to providing babies all over the world with the best seat!

Baby Boomers is a site that gifts Users the ability to view the latest and safest options for securing a baby.  Displaying several different options from car seats to high chairs, Baby Boomers has the User covered, providing  narrowed search options by "category" or even as specific as "brand".

Using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Node.JS the site will be operated using abstract buttons that will provide the User with desired output by inheriting various properties.

  In HTML: use buttons or links along with an input to GET data
  In CSS: use styles to make the page "baby friendly"
  In Backend: use JS, along with Mongoose, MongoDB, and Node.JS to create an API utilizing controllers, models, and routes to collect and provide information in a variety of ways
